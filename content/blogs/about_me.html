<p>I was born in <strong>Romania</strong> and spent my childhood and teenage years in <strong>Bucharest</strong>. In my free time, I enjoy travelling, going to the gym, walking around the city and discovering new places and going out with my friends</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>After high school, I started my Bachelors in Systems Engineering at <a href="https://upb.ro/en/">Polytechnica University of Bucharest</a>. I graduated from college in June 2022, right before starting my Masters at <a href="https://www.london.edu/masters-degrees/masters-in-analytics-and-management">London Business School</a>.</p>

<h2>Work experience</h2>
<p>I started my professional career as a Software Engineer working at a VC-backed start-up. After 10 months in the role, I realized programming is not what I want to do going forward so I started to explore other career paths and look for a more social role. I decided to go into Venture Capital and joined Speedinvest, an early-stage VC fund with over 500m AUM.</p>
