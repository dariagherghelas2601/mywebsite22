<div id="gdp-components-over-time-and-among-countries" class="section level1">
<h1>GDP components over time and among countries</h1>
<p>At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file we will work with is <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a> and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised</p>
<pre class="r"><code>UN_GDP_data  &lt;-  read_excel(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls&quot;), # Excel filename
                sheet=&quot;Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr&quot;, # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip</code></pre>
<p>The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by <code>1e9</code>, or <span class="math inline">\(10^9\)</span>), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_GDP_data  &lt;-  UN_GDP_data %&gt;% 
  gather(key = year, value = GDP, &#39;1970&#39;:&#39;2017&#39;) %&gt;%

<p>First, can you produce this plot?</p>

<p>Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator <code>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</code> in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.</p>

<p>What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?</p>

<p>The % difference between what I calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe is 0.87%.</p>

<p>What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since all three countries we study have experienced overall positive GDP growth over the last 50 years, we can see from the graph that the composition of GDP is very different in each country. The United States has experienced rapid growth in household spending and a decline in government spending, suggesting that most U.S. households have become wealthier and the economy is less dependent on government spending. Germany has experienced stable household spending over the years, but growing exports, suggesting that Germany has a huge advantage in manufacturing, which is recognized worldwide. India, however, has seen a rapid decline in household spending. Although the Indian economy has grown statistically, it is not healthy or sustainable. It is heavily dependent on gross capital formation.</p>
