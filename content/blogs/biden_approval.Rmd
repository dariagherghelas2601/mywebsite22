# Biden's Approval Margins
                        
As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls 
that track the president's approval](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

#glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist$modeldate <- mdy(approval_polllist$modeldate)
approval_polllist$startdate <- mdy(approval_polllist$startdate)
approval_polllist$enddate <- mdy(approval_polllist$enddate)
approval_polllist$createddate <- mdy(approval_polllist$createddate)

glimpse(approval_polllist)

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval
rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I
want you plot the net approval for each week in 2022, along with its 95%
confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please
use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

```{r}
# Calculate the average net approval rate for each week and its 95% confidence interval
avg_approval_rate <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(week = week(enddate), #get week out of the enddate
         year = year(enddate), #get year out of the enddate
         avg_net_approval = (approve-disapprove)) %>% #calculate the average net approval
  filter(year == 2022) %>%  #fitler by year 2022
  group_by(subgroup,week) %>%  #group by subgroup and week
  summarize(avg_net_approval, 
            mean = mean(avg_net_approval, na.rm = TRUE),  #calcualte mean of the average net approval
            sd = sd(avg_net_approval,na.rm = TRUE),  #calculate standard deviation of the average net approval
            count = n(),  
            error=(qt(0.95, df = count - 1)*sd/sqrt(count)), #calculate the margin of error
            diff_rate_low  = mean - error,  #lower bound of the 95% confidence interval
            diff_rate_high = mean + error)  #upper bound of the 95% confidence interval

#Plot the data
ggplot(avg_approval_rate) +
  aes(x=week, y = mean) +  #plotn the average net approval
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~subgroup, nrow = 3, strip.position="right")+  #group by subgroup and devide in 3 different graphs
  geom_ribbon(alpha=0.3, fill = "orange") +  #plot the confidence interval
  aes(ymin = diff_rate_low, ymax = diff_rate_high, colour = subgroup) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(title = "Biden's Net Approval Ratings in 2022", 
              subtitle = "Weekly Data, Approve - Disapprove, %", 
              caption = "Source: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data",
              x = "Week in 2022",
              y = element_blank())
```
