I was born in **Romania** and spent my childhood and teenage years in **Bucharest**.  In my free time, I enjoy travelling, going to the gym, walking around the city and discovering new places and going out with my friends

## Education
After high school, I started my Bachelors in Systems Engineering at [Polytechnica University of Bucharest]( https://upb.ro/en/). I graduated from college in June 2022, right before starting my Masters at [London Business School](https://www.london.edu/masters-degrees/masters-in-analytics-and-management). 

## Work experience
I started my professional career as a Software Engineer working at a VC-backed start-up. After 10 months in the role, I realized programming is not what I want to do going forward so I started to explore other career paths and look for a more social role. I decided to go into Venture Capital and joined Speedinvest, an early-stage VC fund with over 500m AUM.
